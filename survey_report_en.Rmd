## Introduction

This document visualizes results of the international [survey by Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication](https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/wintoncovid1) about people's attitudes towards the risk of coronavirus, and their governmentsâ€™ reactions. For details see article [published in the Journal of Risk Research on 05 May 2020](https://doi.org/10.1080/13669877.2020.1758193) [@dryhurst2020].

Data were collected during March and April 2020.

## Risk perception index 

As shown in [@dryhurst2020], risk perception can be aggregated into an index, which combines answers to the following questions

```{r idx_var_1}

```
<br>
Rescaling of questions on 1..5 scale is done with $NewScore = OldScore * 1.5 - 0.5$. One of the question is stated with negation (i.e. "will NOT affect"), so the answers need to be inverted. Once the scores are rescaled they can be averaged across the answers to the questions in the table above. 

Now we can compare distribution of Risk index by country.

```{r idx_var_2, fig.width=7, fig.height=6}

```
